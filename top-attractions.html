  The Great Wall of China is a famous ancient structure that stretches over 13,000 miles across northern China. Built to defend against invasions, it dates back to around the 7th century BC and was expanded during the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644). Made from earth, wood, and stone, it's a remarkable feat of ancient engineering and a symbol of China's history.

  Sichuan pandas, also called giant pandas, are super popular in China. They live in the mountainous bamboo forests of Sichuan Province and are known for their black-and-white fur and playful behavior. Pandas mostly eat bamboo, munching up to 40 pounds a day! Sadly, they're endangered because of habitat loss and low birth rates. But conservation efforts in Sichuan and other places are working hard to protect them and their homes, so we can keep enjoying these amazing animals for years to come.

<p>Tiananmen Square is a huge landmark in the middle of Beijing, China. It’s one of the biggest city squares ever, covering more than 100 acres. It’s surrounded by important buildings like the Forbidden City and the Great Hall of the People. Throughout China’s history, it’s been a big deal for political and cultural events. You might remember it from the 1989 pro-democracy protests and that famous picture of "Tank Man." People still visit today to see the big open space, the monuments, and the national flag ceremonies. It’s like a symbol of China’s past and present all in one place.
